Description: TinyPath
        ========
        
        TinyPath is a tiny file path module that provides only the most crucial
        and commonly needed functionality, including turning files and folders
        into classes. Designed as a companion module for projects that require
        handling arbitrary paths from users without breaking, and easy
        navigation of local file systems.
        
        By staying tiny in both size and functionality, the API is easy to learn
        so you can start using it right away. Essentially, it provides
        object-oriented access to files and folders with several convenient
        attributes such as checking file or folder size, handling a lot of the
        intricacies of os.path behind the scene so you do not have to.
